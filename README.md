## Flipnote Studio Player for Nintendo DS

Note from January 2021 : *"Unburied" dekvkitPro from a 3yo hard disk backup, so I decided to give it a go :)*

This simple ROM allows you to play flipnotes on Nintendo DS (Lite) using your flashcard.

## How to use

1. Create a new folder named ```/flipnotes``` at the root of your SD card
1. Copy your favorite flipnotes to ```/flipnotes``` directory
1. Copy ```FSPDS.nds``` anywhere to your SD card
1. Insert your flashcard into the DS, then turn on the console
1. Launch ```FSPDS.nds```
1. Select a file from the menu using the D-pad
1. Press ```A``` to play it
1. Use ```L```/```R``` buttons to navigate through bottom-screen tabs

## Bugs/Limitations

- FSPDS doesn't detect/play flipnotes larger than 1MB (this is intentional behavior)
- Don't place more than 1024 files in the ```/flipnotes``` directory, otherwise FSPDS won't be capable to see them all 
(also intentional behavior, probably will be changed in the future)
- The flipnote's BGM track should be smaller than 512KB in order to be played correctly. 

### Tested on DeSmuMe emulator and R4(i) flashcards
