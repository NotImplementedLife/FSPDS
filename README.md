Note from January 2021 : *"Unburied" dekvkitPro from a 3yo hard disk backup, so I decided to give it a go :)*

This simple ROM allows you to play flipnotes on Nintendo DS (Lite) using your flashcard.

## How to use


1. Create a new folder named ```/flipnotes``` at the root of your SD card
1. Copy your favorite flipnotes to ```/flipnotes``` directory
1. Copy ```FSPDS.nds``` anywhere to your SD card
1. Insert your flashcard into the DS, then turn on the console
1. Launch ```FSPDS.nds```
1. Select a file from the menu using the D-pad
1. Press ```A``` to play it
1. Use ```L```/```R``` buttons to navigate through bottom-screen tabs

## Features

- Supposing you are a TwilightMenu++ user (or any other DSi CFW), or you use the same SD card for both the DSi and a DS flashcard,
  FSPDS automatically detects default flipnote export paths for you so that you are not required to copy those files to a `/flipnotes` directory.
- A screen saver turns off the bottom screen on 5 seconds of inactivity during flipnote playback. Also, this option can be manually
  triggered by pressing the screen saver icon on the Player Tab. *

## Bugs/Limitations

- FSPDS doesn't detect/play flipnotes larger than 1MB (this is intentional behavior)
- The flipnote's BGM track should be smaller than 512KB in order to be played correctly. However, the DSi Flipnote Studio only allows
for 1 minute of raw audio (8192Hz) to be encoded into a flipnote, which means at most 240KB of sound data. Therefore, FSPDS should not have
problems playing original flipnotes. Spin-off flipnotes which contain huge audio data may not play correctly with this application.

<b>Tested on DeSmuMe emulator and R4(i) flashcards </b>

### Hardware vs emulator compatibility

- On the hardware, loading files from FAT system is substantialy faster;
- For some reason, the screen saver does not work on DeSmuME emulating in R4 mode. This doesn't affect the actual user experience.
